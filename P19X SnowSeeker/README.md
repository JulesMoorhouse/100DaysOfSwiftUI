# Day 99 | [HWS 99](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/99) | [Index](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/README.md)

- [ContentView.swift](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/P19X%20SnowSeeker/P19C%20SnowSeeker/ContentView.swift)

- Challenge.
  - Add a photo credit over the ResortView image. The data is already loaded from the JSON for this purpose, so you just need to make it look good in the UI.
  - Fill in the loading and saving methods for Favorites.
  - For a real challenge, let the user sort and filter the resorts in ContentView. For sorting use default, alphabetical, and country, and for filtering let them select country, size, or price.
