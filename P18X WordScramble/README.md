# Day 94 | [HWS 94](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/94) | [Index](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/README.md)

- [P18X WordScramble](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/P18X%20WordScramble/P05C%20WordScramble/ContentView.swift) 

- Change project 5 (Word Scramble) so that words towards the bottom of the list slide in from the right as you scroll. Ideally at least the top 8-10 words should all be positioned normally, but after that they should be offset increasingly to the right.
  
- For a real challenge make the letter count images in project 5 change color as you scroll. For the best effect, you should create colors using the Color(red:green:blue:) initializer, feeding in values for whichever of red, green, and blue you want to modify. The values to input can be figured out using the rowâ€™s current position divided by maximum position, which should give you values in the range 0 to 1.
