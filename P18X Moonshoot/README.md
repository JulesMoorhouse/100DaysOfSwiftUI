# Day 94 | [HWS 94](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/94) | [Index](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/README.md)

- [P18X Moonshoot](https://github.com/JulesMoorhouse/100DaysOfSwiftUI/blob/main/P18X%20Moonshoot/P08D%20Moonshoot/ContentView.swift) 

- Change project 8 (Moonshot) so that when you scroll down in MissionView the mission badge image gets smaller. It doesn’t need to shrink away to nothing – going down to maybe 80% is fine.
